# Background Generator

# Project
Created a linear-gradient background generator (idea from ZTM). Needed to make sure there were two html input type=color, with a random button to select the colors for the user. Users can click either color input and select their own, but the button will generate two distinct colors when pressed. Below are the RGB, HEX, and HSL colors to copy for your own projects.
# Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
# Learning
The concept of creating a random generator was simple, using JS to create a function and call it when the button is pressed. Using Math.floor and Math.random allowed for the randomness. When I first created the colors I was not sure how they would type out for the user. To my surprise it was RGB. The hardest part was figuring out the formulas for the HSL and HEX values from the RGB value.  I will say the HSL was the hardest function and I could probably write it better, but I am at the point of if it is not broken do not mess with it. 
I also created function to change the color of the font from white/black to make it easier to read. Before I did the function everything was the same color and sometimes it was hard to read. 
# Updating Code
I will continue to work on simplifying the code, but I do not see any code that is not DRY. But there might be a way to produce less JS code.
